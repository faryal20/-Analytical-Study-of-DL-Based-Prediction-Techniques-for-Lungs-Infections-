# lungsInfection

This work is based on a dataset which includes 3071 chest X-ray images (120 were infected with COVID-19, 412 were Viral Pneumonia, 650 Bacterial Pneumonia and 901 were normal). All Data sets are organized in three directories, one for training and the second for testing /validation as ValData and the third one named as NonaugmentedData for not augmented data. In each directory of the three (training, testing  and validation), four open folders equal to the number of classes, then in each class, the images examples of this class are input. The evaluation and comparison is performed by using Keras Models of MobileNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50 and by applying different layers Flatten, Convolutional layer, pooling layer and Dense layer. The extracted information will help the practitioner in order to write the precise and wise prescription for (Covid-19) patients.
